/*! \def JKQTCOMMON_STATISTICS_AND_MATH_LIB_EXPORT
    \ingroup jkqtcommon_statistics_and_math_libfacilities

    This define allows to export functions and classes from the jkqtcommon_statistics_and_math-library when building a dynamic/shared library.
    Usage is as follows:
    \code
        #include "jkqtcommon_statistics_and_math_imexport/jkqtcommon_statistics_and_math_imexport.h"

        class JKQTCOMMON_STATISTICS_AND_MATH_LIB_EXPORT exportedClassName {
           ...
        };

        JKQTCOMMON_STATISTICS_AND_MATH_LIB_EXPORT void exportedFunctionName();
    \endcode
    
    These macros append the appropriate \c Q_DECL_EXPORT and \c Q_DECL_IMPORT
    to the function/class body and thus tell windows compilers to export these sysmbols from
    the shared library, or import them from a shared library.
    
    Note that these attributes are only necessary on windows systems!
    
    These macros are controlled by two other macros:
      - \c JKQTCOMMON_STATISTICS_AND_MATH_LIB_IN_DLL declares that the application should link against a shared version of 
                                 JKQTCommonStatisticsAndMath, i.e. \c JKQTCommonStatisticsAndMathSharedLib_XYZ .
                                 This needs to be defined while compiling the library and while compiling 
                                 any application linking against  \c JKQTCommonStatisticsAndMathSharedLib_XYZ. 
      - \c JKQTCOMMON_STATISTICS_AND_MATH_LIB_EXPORT_LIBRARY is only defined while compiling JKQTCommonStatisticsAndMath into \c JKQTCommonStatisticsAndMathSharedLib_XYZ
                                 and ensures thet the symbols are exported. If it is not defined (e.g. while 
                                 compiling an application), the symbols are imported
    .
